Architecture Principles
Encapsulation & Responsibility

Email Notification Service: Focuses exclusively on managing email-related tasksâ€”dispatch, deliverability tracking, and status updates.
Single Source of Truth

Consistency: Central management of email status and metrics within the Email Notification Service ensures accurate and up-to-date information.
Decoupling

Modular Design: Components interact through defined interfaces/events, reducing dependencies and supporting scalability.
Implementation Strategy
Manages Email Dispatch

Email Sending: Handles sending emails via configured providers and ensures successful delivery.
Tracks and Notifies Deliverability

Monitoring: Keeps track of delivery statuses and provides APIs or notifications for access.
Approaches
Event-Driven Architecture

Event Emission: Emits events at each critical stage of the email lifecycle, allowing other system components to react.
Strategy Pattern for Email Providers

Dynamic Selection: Chooses email providers (e.g., AWS SES, Mailgun) based on configuration or runtime conditions.
Factory Pattern for Strategy Creation

Flexible Instantiation: Encapsulates logic for creating email provider strategies, making the system adaptable to new providers.
Retry Logic with Queues (e.g., SQS)

Resilience: Implements retry mechanisms using message queues, enhancing email delivery reliability.
Fallback Mechanism

Automatic Switching: On persistent delivery failures, switches to a fallback provider to maximize email deliverability.
Reporting & Code Location
Centralized Reporting

Comprehensive Data: Gathers and provides insights on email activities for monitoring and analytics.
Code Organization

Email Dispatch: Code located in /email-dispatch for sending emails.
Deliverability Tracking: Code located in /deliverability-tracking for monitoring email statuses.
Direct Implementation vs. Pattern-Inspired Design
Direct Implementation

Pros: Simple and provides direct control; suitable for straightforward needs.
Cons: Can become rigid and challenging to refactor; less flexible with provider extensibility and retry logic.
Pattern-Inspired Design

Pros:
Scalability: Accommodates new providers and evolving requirements.
Maintainability: Loose coupling and high cohesion enhance maintainability and extensibility.
Reliability: Retry and fallback mechanisms improve delivery success rates.
Cons:
Initial Complexity: Requires understanding of design patterns and their applications.
Risk of Over-Engineering: Potentially introduces unnecessary complexity.
Conclusion
Adopting a pattern-inspired design for the Email Notification Service promotes robustness, flexibility, and maintainability. It supports handling complex scenarios, such as provider failures and retries, efficiently. By encapsulating core email functionalities and separating concerns, the architecture is well-suited to adapt to changing business needs and technological advancements.

Additional Considerations
Testing: Ensure comprehensive unit and integration tests, especially for error handling and edge cases.

Documentation: Maintain detailed documentation for both the architecture and individual components to assist with onboarding and future development.

Security: Secure API endpoints and ensure proper handling of sensitive information such as API keys and credentials.

Performance Monitoring: Implement monitoring and alerting for performance and operational metrics to promptly address any issues.

User Feedback: Consider implementing feedback mechanisms to gather insights from users and continuously improve the notification service.

This structured approach will help create a scalable, reliable, and maintainable email notification system.
